# What did I learn? 
## CSS Notes
1. flex:1 -> space divided between them equally. 
2. we make overlay with two methods: 
with div 
or 
with before and after pseudo. 
3. when I make overlay with before or after pseudo for main div I must ust
"position:relative" in child div 
to make text or any thing in child div appear on overlay. 
4. to put icon in before or after we put "\icon unicode" in content before.
